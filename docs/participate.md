## Rules and Engagement:
- **Eligibility**: The competition is open to anyone interested in skin spectral analysis, regardless of their affiliations or backgrounds. Participants must register through the designated registration process and agree to abide by the competition rules.

- **Registration**: To register for the competition, participants must provide valid email addresses for all team members. Double registration is not allowed, meaning a team member cannot be in different groups.

- **Data Usage**: Participants can use external data and pretrained models in their submissions. However, they must submit a request for the external data sources and pretrained models they will use before the release of the validation data. This external data source and pretrained model will be made available in our online forum so that other participants can access them to ensure fairness.

- **Submission Limit**: To avoid cheating and ensure fairness, each team is limited to a maximum of three submissions per day.

- **Validation**: The submitted results will be evaluated on the validation data set, and the organizers will keep a hidden test set for final evaluation.

- **Presentation**: The top-performing team will be invited to give a talk during a workshop at an in-person event to showcase their solution. Additionally, they will be invited to co-author the paper to be submitted to the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks Track in 2024. Clear requirements for authorship levels in the publication process will be provided.

- **Ethical Considerations**: Participants are expected to follow ethical guidelines while conducting their research and submitting their results.

- **Fairness**: The competition will be conducted in a fair and transparent manner. Any disputes or concerns will be addressed promptly by the organizers.

- **Code of Conduct**: Participants must adhere to the competition's code of conduct, which prohibits harassment, discrimination, and other inappropriate behavior.

- **Disqualification**: The organizers reserve the right to disqualify any participant who violates the competition rules or engages in unethical or inappropriate behavior.
