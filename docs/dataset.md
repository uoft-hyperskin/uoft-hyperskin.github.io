The data that will be used in the competition is carefully collected and curated following the ethical guidelines approved by the Human Research Ethics Program (HREP) at the University of Toronto. 
% Approval was obtained prior to the data collection.
Figure below shows the schematic of our setup for the data collection.
The hyperspectral camera used to collect the hyperspectral image is Specim FX10~\cite{}. 
The Specim FX10 camera has a spectral range of 400-1000 nm, with a total of 448 bands, and a spatial resolution of 1024 $\times$ 1024 pixels. 
The frame rate of the camera is set to 45 Hz. 
Since the Specim FX10 is a line-scan camera, it took approximately 22.7 s to finish scan the entire hypercube of dimension 1024 $\times$ 1024 $\times$ 448.
The camera was placed at a distance of 40 cm from the subject, who was required to sit on a stool during the data collection. To ensure sufficient lighting for the imaging process, two halogen lights were used and pointed at 45 degrees to the subject. The halogen lights were used because they have a broad spectrum and provide stable illumination for the imaging process.
